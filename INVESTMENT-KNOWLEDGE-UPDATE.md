# Stock Trading Chatbot - Investment Knowledge Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the ML-powered stock trading chatbot with comprehensive US market investment knowledge and improved symbol extraction.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI System Prompt
**Location**: `lambda-micro/chatbot-router/handler.py:163-172`

Added comprehensive investment knowledge to the OpenAI system prompt:

- **Market Structure**: NYSE (largest), Nasdaq (tech-focused), major indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq Composite)
- **Investment Instruments**: Stocks (common/preferred, growth/value), bonds, mutual funds/ETFs
- **Investment Strategies**:
  - Value investing (low P/E, long-term holds)
  - Growth investing (high-earnings tech stocks)
  - Diversification (spread risk via ETFs)
- **Key Regulations**:
  - Securities Act 1933 (disclosure requirements)
  - Exchange Act 1934 (SEC oversight, anti-fraud Rule 10b-5)
  - Sarbanes-Oxley (corporate transparency)
  - Dodd-Frank (consumer protection)
- **Power Players' Philosophies**:
  - Warren Buffett: Value investing, long-term hold ("own for 10 years")
  - Peter Lynch: Invest in what you know, reasonable P/E
  - Ray Dalio: Risk-balanced portfolios ("All Weather" strategy)

### 2. Improved Symbol Extraction
**Location**: `lambda-micro/chatbot-router/handler.py:32-50`

**Problem**: The bot was incorrectly extracting common English words as stock symbols (e.g., "DO", "IT", "IS", "KEY", "MAJOR")

**Solution**: Expanded the common_words blacklist from 44 words to 120+ words, including:
- Verbs: DO, THINK, HELP, WORK, LEARN, START, MAKE, TAKE
- Prepositions: IT, IS, AS, AT, BE, BY, IF, IN, OF, ON, OR, TO
- Finance terms: INVEST, INVESTING, VALUE, GROWTH, RISK, RISKS
- Adjectives: KEY, MAJOR, MINOR, BASIC, HIGH, LOW, LONG
- Regulatory: SEC, RULE, ACT, LAW, LAWS, NYSE

**Result**: General investment questions now correctly route to OpenAI without attempting to fetch invalid stock data.
