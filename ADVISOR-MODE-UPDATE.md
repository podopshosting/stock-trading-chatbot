Added to existing knowledge base:
- **Momentum trading**: Ride trends for short-term gains
- **Penny stocks**: High-risk, high-reward plays under $5
- **Position sizing**: Portfolio allocation recommendations

### 3. Increased Response Length
- **max_tokens**: 300 ‚Üí 400
- **Word limit**: 150 ‚Üí 200 words
